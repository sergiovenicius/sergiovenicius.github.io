I’ve been really enjoying a Visual Studio extension that helps me build unit tests into my projects. It’s called Fine Code Coverage.

Unit testing coverage is something that caught my attention when I discovered it, and I saw it initially in an automated process. Since then I researched on how to bring this to my local environment.

With this Visual Studio extension, it is possible to identify in the IDE which parts of the code are not covered by tests, how much percent of the entire code is covered, and in an easy and fast way.

There is the report, generated after the execution of the tests, which lists the entire project files and how much coverage each one has; and there is also the green/red visual signaling of the line of code covered or not by test, great while navigating the code.

Below some examples :)
