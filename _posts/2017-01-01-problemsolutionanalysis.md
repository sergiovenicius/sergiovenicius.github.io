These questions were a way I found to criticize systems analyzes that I did and that I will possibly do in the future. But I think it can be used in any problem and solution analysis.

Ask **WHAT?** Try to understand the **WHAT** by asking **WHY?** Then think of several ways to solve the problem, through different **HOW?**, don’t disregard anyone, consider the most “idiotic” **HOW** possible too. This is the **WHY NOT?**

For each **HOW**, look for the problems, and reapply the template above.

Write in a list the **HOW?** Critique each of them. Write pros and cons.

Select as many **HOWs** as possible to be developed in the analysis time you have. Apply the **TRY**. If you come across another solution, consider the **WHY NOT** and put this new possible solution on the HOW list.

Write objectively about each **HOW** and its **TRY**. Write so that it is understood, and also so that it is not misunderstood.
